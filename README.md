LaTex equations to Python function model

Developed a system to convert LaTeX mathematical expressions into Python code using the T5 p model with 770M parameters, fine-tuning it on a synthetically created train set. Utilized Hugging Face, tqdm, LoRA, bitsandbytes, torch, and pandas libraries to enhance accuracy and efficiency in the conversion process, optimizing the model for symbolic computation tasks.
